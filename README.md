Olympic Games Historical Data Analysis:

Project Overview:

This project explores the rich history of the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016, analyzing key aspects such as events, participants, medals, and regional representation. By leveraging historical data, the analysis identifies trends, patterns, and significant insights spanning multiple editions of the Olympics. The primary goal is to provide a detailed overview of the Olympics' evolution and generate actionable recommendations to enhance future organization, sports selection, and representation diversity. The final deliverables include interactive Power BI reports and insights derived from SQL-based EDA scenarios, visualized in Excel.


Dataset Description:

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the Olympic Games (1896–2016), with interconnected tables capturing various dimensions of the event's history:
•	Sport Table: Details of all sports featured in the Olympics, categorized into events.

•	Event Table: Information about events, including gender-specific classifications.

•	City Table: List of cities that have hosted or participated in the Olympics.

•	Games Table: Record of all Olympic Games editions since 1896.

•	Games City Table: Links Olympic Games to host cities, including joint-hosting instances.

•	NOC Region Table: Maps NOC codes to participating countries.

•	Person Table: Information about athletes, including demographic details.

•	Person Region Table: Links athletes to countries they represented.

•	Games Competitor Table: Details of participants in each Olympic Games.

•	Medal Table: Types of medals awarded (Gold, Silver, Bronze, N/A).

•	Competitor Event Table: Largest table capturing competitors, events, and medals awarded.


Key Objectives:

•	Analyze event trends to understand the evolution of sports and competitions.
•	Explore participant demographics to identify representation patterns.
•	Evaluate medal distribution and performance trends across countries.
•	Analyze regional representation to gain insights into global participation dynamics.
•	Solve 18 EDA scenarios to uncover additional patterns and insights.

EDA Scenarios:

18 scenario-based questions were solved using SQL and visualized in Excel, covering topics such as:

•	Identifying the top-performing countries by medal count.

•	Exploring gender representation trends in specific events.

•	Analyzing host city patterns and their impact on participation.

•	Trends in athlete demographics such as height and weight over time.


Tools & Technologies:

•	SQL: For exploratory data analysis and insights generation.

•	Excel: Visualization of SQL outputs for EDA scenarios.

•	Power BI: Creation of dynamic, interactive dashboards.


Key Insights:

•	The diversity of events has increased significantly over the years, with new sports introduced to cater to modern trends.

•	Gender representation has steadily improved, with a near-equal distribution in recent editions.

•	A handful of countries dominate medal tallies, but smaller nations have increasingly gained recognition.

•	Host cities experience significant spikes in regional participation during their hosting years.
